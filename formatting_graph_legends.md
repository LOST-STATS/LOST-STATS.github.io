# Formatting graph legends

Graphs and charts are an instrumental way to explain and visualize your data and results. However, graph legends are often overlooked but are one of the most important aspects when presenting your data. Without an effective legend, the information you want intended to convey can get misinterpreted by the reader.

## Keep in Mind

**What makes a good legend?**

1. Title
- You should include a brief title that encompasses the whole figure. The title should answer the question *"what is this figure about?"* clearly and concicely. 

2. Definitions and descriptions
- This is the section where you can explain all the different components contained within the figure. This inclues any key symbols, colors, scale changes, lines or other compenets that are needed to understand the information clearly. 

3. Methods *(optional)*
- This is a very short description of the statistical methods used. The best way to approach this is to try and simplify the methods section so the figure can stand alone from the rest of the paper. 

4. Results *(optional)*
- Include a sentence or two that summarizes the results that can be found in that particular graph.

**Avoid clutter**
- It is important to keep these legends simple, an effective legend is there to help the graph stand alone.

## Also Consider

Before finalizing your legend the graph itself should be completed. Deciding which type of graph is best suited for your data is a whole topic in itself. For information on choosing and creating different types of graphs, you can explore the Presentation tab located on the LOST website. [Presentation](https://lost-stats.github.io/Presentation/Presentation.html#presentation) 

Some of the graphical implementations this page contains include are;
[Bar Graphs](https://lost-stats.github.io/Presentation/bar_graphs.html), [Histograms](https://lost-stats.github.io/Presentation/histograms.html), and [Scatterplot by Group on Shared Axes](https://lost-stats.github.io/Presentation/scatterplot_by_group_on_shared_axes.html).

# Implementations

## R



## NAME OF LANGUAGE/SOFTWARE 2 WHICH HAS MULTIPLE APPROACHES

There are two ways to perform this technique in language/software 2.

First, explanation of what is different about the first way:

```identifier for language type, see this page: https://github.com/jmm/gfm-lang-ids/wiki/GitHub-Flavored-Markdown-%28GFM%29-language-IDs
Commented code demonstrating the technique
```
